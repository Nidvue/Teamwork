## [1.0.0](https://github.com/VisionPZ/Teamwork/releases/tag/v1.0.0) - 2026-10-17

### Added

- Installable `teamwork-agents` package exposing the `teamwork` console script
  and `python -m teamwork`.
- The skill bundle (`SKILL.md`, `roles/`, `references/`, `templates/`) is
  force-included into the wheel at `teamwork/data/`.
- Documentation site (MkDocs Material) with installation, quickstart, CLI
  reference, architecture and CI guides.
- Community files: `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `SECURITY.md`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`,
  `CITATION.cff` and this changelog.
- Offline `teamwork selftest` smoke check and `--version` reporting.
- Hash-chained ledger with `ledger verify`, `ledger export` and `trace`.
- CI pipeline: lint, type-check, the test matrix on Linux/macOS/Windows and
  Python 3.9/3.11/3.13, build + wheel verification, privacy scan and strict docs
  build.

### Changed

- Extracted the 7,416-line `teamwork.py` monolith into `src/teamwork/`, keeping
  `scripts/teamwork.py` as a thin compatibility shim.
- Resource discovery now resolves the skill bundle from a checkout and from an
  installed wheel.
- The runtime has no third-party dependencies; file output is UTF-8 with `\n`
  newlines for byte-identical results across platforms.

### Security

- Added a privacy scanner that runs over the working tree and the full git
  history; no personal data, credentials or keys are published.
- Commit identity defaults to the configurable `agents.nidvue.com` domain.
- Private vulnerability disclosure is handled exclusively through GitHub Security
  Advisories.
