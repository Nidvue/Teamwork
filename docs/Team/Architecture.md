# ARCHITECTURE - Teamwork

## 1. What the system is

`Teamwork` is simultaneously:

1. **A skill** - `SKILL.md`, `roles/`, `references/`, `templates/` at the
   repository root, loadable from a project or user skills directory
   (`.agents/skills/teamwork`).
2. **A Python package** - `src/teamwork/`, installable with `pip install .`,
   exposing the `teamwork` console script and `python -m teamwork`.
3. **A workspace format** - markdown + JSON under
   `<project>/.pi/Teamwork/Teams/<Team>/`.

The three share one engine. The engine started as a behaviour-preserving port of
the original 7,416-line `teamwork.py` monolith. It is now a thin command layer
over typed modules; the move was behaviour-preserving and is covered by the same
suite.

## 3. Resource-resolution contract (`resources.py`)

The engine needs four resource groups: `SKILL.md`, `roles/`, `references/`,
`templates/`, and a runnable engine path. Resolution order, first hit wins:

```
1. $TEAMWORK_SKILL_DIR                             (explicit override, tests use this)
2. importlib.resources.files("teamwork") / "data"   (installed wheel)
3. the repository root                             (git checkout: <repo>/src/teamwork/)
4. Path(__file__).parent.parent                    (the directory holding the package, e.g. src/)
```

Public API (frozen):

```python
skill_root() -> Path            # directory holding SKILL.md + roles/ + references/ + templates/
asset(*parts) -> Path           # skill_root() joined with parts
self_invocation() -> str        # machine-local command (absolute; private .pi/ state only)
portable_invocation() -> str    # committed command, never a machine path (AGENTS.md)
has_asset(name: str) -> bool
```

`self_invocation()` returns, in order of preference:

1. `teamwork` when the console script is on `PATH`;
2. `<sys.executable> <skill>/scripts/teamwork.py` when the shim exists (a checkout);
3. `<sys.executable> -m teamwork` (an installed package without the shim).

`config.py` calls `resources.skill_root()`; `engine.py` and every other module
import the resolved paths from `config`. The dependency direction is
`config <- io/names <- layout <- records`, and `engine` sits on top. Only the
`cli` entry point imports `engine` at import time, so the command layer can be
exercised without a cycle.

## 4. CLI contract (frozen, backward compatible)

Invocation forms, all equivalent:

```
teamwork <cmd> ...            # console script
python -m teamwork <cmd> ...  # module
python scripts/teamwork.py <cmd> ...   # checkout shim
```

Additions to the original surface (no removals, no renames):

| Addition | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| `--version` | prints `teamwork <version>` and exits 0 |
| `version` subcommand | same as `--version` |
| `teamwork selftest` | runs an offline smoke check of the workspace (used by CI) |

Every existing subcommand, flag and exit code is unchanged. Exit codes are part
of the contract:

| Code | Meaning | Sites measured at v1.1.0 |
|---|---|---|
| `0` | success | the completing path of every command |
| `1` | generic error or gate refusal; the `die()` default | `io.die(msg, code=1)`, `loop` CONTINUE (`return 1 if blockers else 0`) |
| `2` | usage error, or a gate that calls `die(..., 2)` explicitly | `identity --audit` bad range, dispute round past `MAX_ROUNDS`, unrecoverable workspace state, `review --claim/--release` misuse, review independence refusals |
| `3` | nothing to dispatch, or nothing matched the query | `criteria list` empty, `tests plan` with no declared area, `trace` no match, `task next` no executable task, `pulse` nothing to assign |
| `4` | lock acquisition timeout (`io.LOCK_TIMEOUT`, default 60s, `$TEAMWORK_LOCK_TIMEOUT`) | `io.lock()`; the message tells the reader to wait, never to delete a live lock |

## 5. Workspace-format contract (frozen)

Unchanged from the skill: `.pi/Teamwork/Teams/<Team>/` with `Roles/<Role>/`
(shared memory + `TaskQueue.md`), `Agents/<Instance>/` (private), `Global/`,
`Runtime/`, `Ledger.jsonl` (hash-chained), `Criteria.md`, `Tests.md`,
`TestPlan.md`, `Reviews.md`, `Disputes.md`.

The ledger record shape and chain (`_digest(prev, record)`) are frozen; changing
them invalidates every existing workspace.

## 6. Portability contract

* Runtime: CPython **3.9 - 3.13**, Linux, macOS, Windows. No third-party import
  at runtime.
* Forbidden in the runtime path: `fcntl`, `termios`, `pwd`, `grp`, `os.fork`,
  `resource`, `shell=True`, POSIX-only signal use.
* All file I/O passes `encoding="utf-8"`; generated text is written with
  `newline="\n"` for byte-identical output across platforms.
* Process liveness for stale-lock recovery must use a portable helper:

```python
def pid_alive(pid: int) -> bool   # Windows-safe; never kills anything
```

* Paths never hardcode `/tmp`, `/home` or a drive letter; use
  `tempfile` / `pathlib` only.

## 7. Packaging contract

* Build backend: `hatchling`. `python -m build` produces
  `dist/teamwork_agents-<v>.tar.gz` and `dist/teamwork_agents-<v>-py3-none-any.whl`.
* Distribution name `teamwork-agents` (PyPI `teamwork` is taken); import name
  `teamwork`; console script `teamwork`.
* Canonical assets are force-included into the wheel at `teamwork/data/`:
  `SKILL.md`, `roles/`, `references/`, `templates/`.
* Runtime dependencies: none (`dependencies = []`). `requires-python = ">=3.9"`.
* The wheel must contain `teamwork/data/SKILL.md` and
  `teamwork/data/templates/AGENTS.md` - `scripts/verify_release.py` asserts this.

## 8. Test contract

| Layer | Location | Owner | Must prove |
|---|---|---|---|
| unit | `tests/unit/` | developer-2, architect | pure functions: parsing, slugify, pascal, identity, ledger digest, task deps, portable locks |
| integration | `tests/integration/` | developer-2 | init → memory → task → criteria → tests → ledger on a tmp workspace |
| acceptance | `tests/acceptance/` | tester-1 | three entrypoints, full selfcheck→review→loop STOP, installed-wheel bootstrap |

Tests must run with `pytest -q` from the repo root and also with an installed
wheel (no reliance on the source tree). `conftest.py` sets
`TEAMWORK_SKILL_DIR` to the repo root and runs each test in a `tmp_path`.

The table above assigns **file writers**. Who must *certify* a layer is a
separate frozen map, `config.LAYER_OWNER`: `unit` -> developer, `integration` ->
tester, `acceptance` -> reviewer, `system` -> architect, plus one owner for each
remaining layer (`goal` -> ceo, `requirements` -> product-manager, `plan` ->
project-manager, `tech` -> cto, `release` -> release-engineer, `data` ->
data-engineer, `process` -> coo, `cost` -> cfo, `ui` -> designer, `docs` ->
technical-writer, `security` -> security-auditor). `tests add` refuses a record
from the wrong role, so the two maps must not be conflated.

## 9. CI / release contract

* `ci.yml`: `lint` (ruff check + format --check + commit-identity audit),
  `typecheck` (mypy, non-blocking report), `test` matrix
  `{ubuntu,macos,windows} x {3.9,3.11,3.13}` plus ubuntu `3.10`/`3.12`,
  `build` (sdist+wheel+verify_release), `privacy`
  (`privacy_scan.py --tree --history --allow .github/privacy-allow.txt`: personal
  data, credentials, agent-host config and tracked local state),
  `docs` (mkdocs build --strict). On `push` the prose and media paths are
  `paths-ignore`d so a docs-only change does not burn the 3x3 matrix; every
  `pull_request` runs the full set, because a path-filtered skip reports no
  check at all and a required check that is never reported blocks the merge.
* `release.yml`: on `v*` tags - build, checksums (`SHA256SUMS`), SBOM
  (CycloneDX JSON + SPDX), attestation, GitHub Release with all assets.
* `docs.yml`: build and deploy the site to GitHub Pages on `main`.
* The Release Engineer pushes reviewed revisions to the remote stage by stage
  (a stage ends with a push, not with a merge)
  (only after the Reviewer passes them, never a red gate); the Tester certifies
  local **and** CI results, routes failures to the owning role, and tags and
  public releases remain the CEO's step.

## 10. Seams for testing

* `resources.skill_root()` honours `TEAMWORK_SKILL_DIR` → tests point the engine
  at a fixture bundle.
* `engine` is importable as a module (`teamwork.engine`) → unit tests call
  functions directly instead of parsing CLI output.
* `--project` / `--team` already exist → every test isolates its workspace.
