## Snapshot (2026-10-20, `main` as `git rev-parse --short main` reports it)

- Milestone: M6 and M7 are merged into `main` (T-0003 landed at `8444134`);
  `v1.0.2` is the latest release and the next records pass is this PR.
- Local gate: `pytest -q` on this branch head -> all pass; the count is read from
  that run and never pinned here, because every commit that adds a test changes it.
  The one skip is the console-script acceptance test (covered by
  `verify_release.py`).
- Privacy: `privacy_scan.py --tree --history --allow .github/privacy-allow.txt`
  -> PASS, 0 findings; the shipped gate passes that allow file (`Makefile`,
  `ci.yml`, `docs.yml`). Without `--allow` the scan reports findings in exactly two
  path families - the pi install tree (`agent-config`) and one operator user name
  (`home-path`) - and no credential rule fires. The no-allow count is read from the
  run and never pinned: most of those hits are the justification text that documents
  the exemption, so the commit that documents the count raises it.
  `tests/unit/test_privacy_scan.py` pins both entries as fully escaped literals,
  rejects a wildcard or a sibling name, and proves a credential on an exempted line
  is still reported. The alternatives (rewriting
  unpublished history, deleting a real reviewer finding) were refused in
  D-20261019-CEO-15: a user name or an install path is not a credential, and a
  credential quoted on the same line is still reported.
- Links: `teamwork.py links` -> 0 problems
- Gate: `teamwork.py loop` -> CONTINUE while any task branch is unmerged, and
  STOP only after the last review lands; `teamwork.py audit` lists one entry per
  open gate and its count moves with each review round, so it is read, not quoted.
  The closing export `docs/Team/AuditManifest.json` is committed with this pass
  and names the revision it was exported from, so it verifies at that head
- Remote: `origin/main` is behind the local merges until the Release Engineer
  pushes the reviewed revision; CI on the pushed SHA is the certification step.

## In flight

| agent | task | prio | state | artifact |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| ceo | T-0028 archive repair | P1 | in review (P-0027) | `Plan.md`, `Board.md`, `Archive.md`, `AuditManifest.json` |

The task queue (`teamwork.py task list ceo`) is authoritative for a task's exact
state; this table only says which lanes are open.

## Dependency PRs (landed)

| PR | bump | outcome |
|---|---|---|
| #11 | `anchore/sbom-action` 0.24.0 -> 0.24.3 | closed; landed in `9b56f1b` via #17 |
| #12 | `actions/attest-build-provenance` -> `4d101475` | closed; landed in `9b56f1b` via #17 |
| #13 | `softprops/action-gh-release` -> `efb35369` | closed; landed in `9b56f1b` via #17 |

The three branches were rebased onto `6905869` (the earlier red Windows jobs came
from the retired umask assertion, fixed in `f2e3b5a`), each passed 17/17 checks,
and they were landed as one reviewed commit. All refs keep the SHA-pinned style
(`uses: owner/action@<sha> # vN`). Missing `ci` and `dependencies` labels were
created so Dependabot can label future PRs.
